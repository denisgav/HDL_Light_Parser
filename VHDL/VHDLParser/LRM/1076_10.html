<H1>Scope and visibility</H1>
<P>The rules defining the scope of declarations and the rules defining which 
identifiers are visible at various points in the text of the description are 
presented in this section. The formulation of these rules uses the notion of a 
declarative region. </P>
<H2><A name=10.1></A><A 
href="1076_10.html#10.1">10.1 
</A>Declarative region</H2>
<P>A declarative region is a portion of the text of the description. A single 
declarative region is formed by the text of each of the following: </P>
<OL type=a>
  <LI>An entity declaration, together with a corresponding architecture 
body.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A configuration declaration.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A subprogram declaration, together with the corresponding subprogram 
  body.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A package declaration, together with the corresponding body (if any).<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A record type declaration.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A component declaration.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A block statement.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A process statement.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A loop statement.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A block configuration.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A component configuration.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A generate statement. </LI></OL>
<P>In each of these cases, the declarative region is said to be 
<I>associated</I> with the corresponding declaration or statement. A declaration 
is said to occur<I> immediately within</I> a declarative region if this region 
is the innermost region that encloses the declaration, not counting the 
declarative region (if any) associated with the declaration itself. </P>
<P>Certain declarative regions include disjoint parts. Each declarative region 
is nevertheless considered as a (logically) continuous portion of the 
description text. Hence, if any rule defines a portion of text as the text that 
<I>extends</I> from some specific point of a declarative region to the end of 
this region, then this portion is the corresponding subset of the declarative 
region (thus, it does not include intermediate declarative items between the 
interface declaration and a corresponding body declaration). </P>
<H2><A name=10.2></A><A 
href="1076_10.html#10.2">10.2 
</A>Scope of declarations</H2>
<P>For each form of declaration, the language rules define a certain portion of 
the description text called the <I>scope of the declaration</I>. The scope of a 
declaration is also called the scope of any named entity declared by the 
declaration. Furthermore, if the declaration associates some notation (either an 
identifier, a character literal, or an operator symbol) with the named entity, 
this portion of the text is also called the scope of this notation. Within the 
scope of a named entity, and only there, there are places where it is legal to 
use the associated notation in order to refer to the named entity. These places 
are defined by the rules of visibility and overloading. </P>
<P>The scope of a declaration that occurs immediately within a declarative 
region extends from the beginning of the declaration to the end of the 
declarative region; this part of the scope of a declaration is called the 
<I>immediate scope</I>. Furthermore, for any of the declarations in the 
following list, the scope of the declaration extends beyond the immediate scope: 
</P>
<OL type=a>
  <LI>A declaration that occurs immediately within a package declaration<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>An element declaration in a record type declaration<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A formal parameter declaration in a subprogram declaration<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A local generic declaration in a component declaration<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A local port declaration in a component declaration<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A formal generic declaration in an entity declaration<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A formal port declaration in an entity declaration<BR></LI></OL>
<P>In the absence of a separate subprogram declaration, the subprogram 
specification given in the subprogram body acts as the declaration, and rule(3) 
applies also in such a case. In each of these cases, the given declaration 
occurs immediately within some enclosing declaration, and the scope of the given 
declaration extends to the end of the scope of the enclosing declaration. </P>
<P>In addition to the above rules, the scope of any declaration that includes 
the end of the declarative part of a given block (whether it be an external 
block defined by a design entity or an internal block defined by a block 
statement) extends into a configuration declaration that configures the given 
block. </P>
<P>If a component configuration appears as a configuration item immediately 
within a block configuration that configures a given block, and if the scope of 
a given declaration includes the end of the declarative part of that block, then 
the scope of the given declaration extends from the beginning to the end of the 
declarative region associated with the given component configuration. A similar 
rule applies to a block configuration that appears as a configuration item 
immediately within another block configuration, provided that the contained 
block configuration configures an internal block. Furthermore, the scope of a 
use clause is similarly extended. Finally, the scope of a library unit contained 
within a design library is extended along with the scope of the logical library 
name corresponding to that design library. </P>
<P>NOTE--These scope rules apply to all forms of declaration. In particular, 
they apply also to implicit declarations. </P>
<H2><A name=10.3></A><A 
href="1076_10.html#10.3">10.3 
</A>Visibility</H2>
<P>The meaning of the occurrence of an identifier at a given place in the text 
is defined by the visibility rules and also, in the case of overloaded 
declarations, by the overloading rules. The identifiers considered in this 
section include any identifier other than a reserved word or attribute 
designator that denotes a predefined attribute. The places considered in this 
section are those where a lexical element (such as an identifier) occurs. The 
overloaded declarations considered in this section are those for subprograms and 
enumeration literals. </P>
<P>For each identifier and at each place in the text, the visibility rules 
determine a set of declarations (with this identifier) that define the possible 
meanings of an occurrence of the identifier. A declaration is said to be visible 
at a given place in the text when, according to the visibility rules, the 
declaration defines a possible meaning of this occurrence. Two cases may arise 
in determining the meaning of such a declaration: </P>
<P>-- The visibility rules determine <I>at most one</I> possible meaning. In 
such a case, the visibility rules are sufficient to determine the declaration 
defining the meaning of the occurrence of the identifier, or in the absence of 
such a declaration, to determine that the occurrence is not legal at the given 
point. </P>
<P>-- The visibility rules determine <I>more than one</I> possible meaning. In 
such a case, the occurrence of the identifier is legal at this point if and only 
if <I>exactly one</I> visible declaration is acceptable for the overloading 
rules in the given context. </P>
<P>A declaration is only visible within a certain part of its scope; this part 
starts at the end of the declaration except in the declaration of a design unit, 
in which case it starts immediately after the reserved word <B>is</B> is given 
after the identifier of the design unit. This rule applies to both explicit and 
implicit declarations. </P>
<P>Visibility is either by selection or direct. A declaration is visible <I>by 
selection</I> at places that are defined as follows: </P>
<OL type=a>
  <LI>For a primary unit contained in a library: at the place of the suffix in a 
  selected name whose prefix denotes the library.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>For an architecture body associated with a given entity declaration: at 
  the place of the block specification in a block configuration for an external 
  block whose interface is defined by that entity declaration.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>For an architecture body associated with a given entity declaration: at 
  the place of an architecture identifier (between the parentheses) in the first 
  form of an entity aspect in a binding indication.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>For a declaration given in a package declaration: at the place of the 
  suffix in a selected name whose prefix denotes the package.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>For an element declaration of a given record type declaration: at the 
  place of the suffix in a selected name whose prefix is appropriate for the 
  type; also at the place of a choice (before the compound delimiter =&gt;) in a 
  named element association of an aggregate of the type.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>For a user-defined attribute: at the place of the attribute 
  designator(after the delimiter ') in an attribute name whose prefix denotes a 
  named entity with which that attribute has been associated.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>For a formal parameter declaration of a given subprogram declaration: at 
  the place of the formal designator in a formal part (before the compound 
  delimiter =&gt;) of a named parameter association element of a corresponding 
  subprogram call.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>For a local generic declaration of a given component declaration: at the 
  place of the formal designator in a formal part (before the compound 
  delimiter=&gt;) of a named generic association element of a corresponding 
  component instantiation statement; similarly, at the place of the actual 
  designator in an actual part (after the compound delimiter =&gt;, if any) of a 
  generic association element of a corresponding binding indication.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>For a local port declaration of a given component declaration: at the 
  place of the formal designator in a formal part (before the compound 
  delimiter=&gt;) of a named port association element of a corresponding 
  component instantiation statement; similarly, at the place of the actual 
  designator in an actual part (after the compound delimiter =&gt;, if any) of a 
  port association element of a corresponding binding indication.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>For a formal generic declaration of a given entity declaration: at the 
  place of the formal designator in a formal part (before the compound 
  delimiter=&gt;) of a named generic association element of a corresponding 
  binding indication; similarly, at the place of the formal designator in a 
  formal part(before the compound delimiter =&gt;) of a generic association 
  element of a corresponding component instantiation statement when the 
  instantiated unit is a design entity or a configuration declaration.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>For a formal port declaration of a given entity declaration: at the place 
  of the formal designator in a formal part (before the compound delimiter=&gt;) 
  of a named port association element of a corresponding binding specification; 
  similarly, at the place of the formal designator in a formal part (before the 
  compound delimiter =&gt;) of a port association element of a corresponding 
  component instantiation statement when the instantiated unit is a design 
  entity or a configuration declaration.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>For a formal generic declaration or a formal port declaration of a given 
  block statement: at the place of the formal designator in a formal part 
  (before the compound delimiter =&gt;) of a named association element of a 
  corresponding generic or port map aspect. </LI></OL>
<P>Finally, within the declarative region associated with a construct other than 
a record type declaration, any declaration that occurs immediately within the 
region and that also occurs textually within the construct is visible by 
selection at the place of the suffix of an expanded name whose prefix denotes 
the construct. </P>
<P>Where it is not visible by selection, a visible declaration is said to be 
<I>directly visible</I>. A declaration is said to be directly visible within a 
certain part of its immediate scope; this part extends to the end of the 
immediate scope of the declaration but excludes places where the declaration is 
hidden as explained in the following paragraphs. In addition, a declaration 
occurring immediately within the visible part of a package can be made directly 
visible by means of a use clause according to the rules described in <A 
href="1076_10.html#10.4">10.4 
</A>. </P>
<P>A declaration is said to be <I>hidden</I> within (part of) an inner 
declarative region if the inner region contains a homograph of this declaration; 
the outer declaration is then hidden within the immediate scope of the inner 
homograph. Each of two declarations is said to be a <I>homograph</I> of the 
other if both declarations have the same identifier, operator symbol, or 
character literal, and if overloading is allowed for at most one of the two. If 
overloading is allowed for both declarations, then each of the two is a 
homograph of the other if they have the same identifier, operator symbol, or 
character literal, as well as the same parameter and result type profile (see <A 
href="1076_3.html#3.1.1">3.1.1 
</A>). </P>
<P>Within the specification of a subprogram, every declaration with the same 
designator as the subprogram is hidden. Where hidden in this manner, a 
declaration is visible neither by selection nor directly. </P>
<P>Two declarations that occur immediately within the same declarative region 
must not be homographs, unless exactly one of them is the implicit declaration 
of a predefined operation. In such cases, a predefined operation is always 
hidden by the other homograph. Where hidden in this manner, an implicit 
declaration is hidden within the entire scope of the other declaration 
(regardless of which declaration occurs first); the implicit declaration is 
visible neither by selection nor directly. </P>
<P>Whenever a declaration with a certain identifier is visible from a given 
point, the identifier and the named entity (if any) are also said to be visible 
from that point. Direct visibility and visibility by selection are likewise 
defined for character literals and operator symbols. An operator is directly 
visible if and only if the corresponding operator declaration is directly 
visible. </P>
<P>In addition to the above rules, any declaration that is visible by selection 
at the end of the declarative part of a given (external or internal) block is 
visible by selection in a configuration declaration that configures the given 
block. </P>
<P>In addition, any declaration that is directly visible at the end of the 
declarative part of a given block is directly visible in a block configuration 
that configures the given block. This rule holds unless a use clause that makes 
a homograph of the declaration potentially visible (see <A 
href="1076_10.html#10.4">10.4 
</A>) appears in the corresponding configuration declaration, and if the scope 
of that use clause encompasses all or part of those configuration items. If such 
a use clause appears, then the declaration will be directly visible within the 
corresponding configuration items, except at those places that fall within the 
scope of the additional use clause. At such places, neither name will be 
directly visible. </P>
<P>If a component configuration appears as a configuration item immediately 
within a block configuration that configures a given block, and if a given 
declaration is visible by selection at the end of the declarative part of that 
block, then the given declaration is visible by selection from the beginning to 
the end of the declarative region associated with the given component 
configuration. A similar rule applies to a block configuration that appears as a 
configuration item immediately within another block configuration, provided that 
the contained block configuration configures an internal block. </P>
<P>If a component configuration appears as a configuration item immediately 
within a block configuration that configures a given block, and if a given 
declaration is directly visible at the end of the declarative part of that 
block, then the given declaration is visible by selection from the beginning to 
the end of the declarative region associated with the given component 
configuration. A similar rule applies to a block configuration that appears as a 
configuration item immediately within another block configuration, provided that 
the contained block configuration configures an internal block. Furthermore, the 
visibility of declarations made directly visible by a use clause within a block 
is similarly extended. Finally, the visibility of a logical library name 
corresponding to a design library directly visible at the end of a block is 
similarly extended. The rules of this paragraph hold unless a use clause that 
makes a homograph of the declaration potentially visible appears in the 
corresponding block configuration, and if the scope of that use clause 
encompasses all or part of those configuration items. If such a use clause 
appears, then the declaration will be directly visible within the corresponding 
configuration items, except at those places that fall within the scope of the 
additional use clause. At such places, neither name will be directly visible. 
</P>
<P>NOTES </P>
<P>1--The same identifier, character literal, or operator symbol may occur 
indifferent declarations and may thus be associated with different named 
entities, even if the scopes of these declarations overlap. Overlap of the 
scopes of declarations with the same identifier, character literal, or operator 
symbol can result from overloading of subprograms and of enumeration literals. 
Such overlaps can also occur for named entities declared in the visible parts of 
packages and for formal generics and ports, record elements, and formal 
parameters, where there is overlap of the scopes of the enclosing package 
declarations, entity interfaces, record type declarations, or subprogram 
declarations. Finally, overlapping scopes can result from nesting. </P>
<P>2--The rules defining immediate scope, hiding, and visibility imply that a 
reference to an identifier, character literal, or operator symbol within its own 
declaration is illegal (except for design units). The identifier,character 
literal, or operator symbol hides outer homographs within its immediate 
scope--that is, from the start of the declaration. On the other hand, the 
identifier, character literal, or operator symbol is visible only after the end 
of the declaration (again, except for design units). For this reason, all but 
the last of the following declarations are illegal: </P><PRE>         <B> </B><B><I>constant</I></B><I> K: INTEGER := K*K;</I><B><I>             </I></B><I> --  Illegal</I><B>

          </B><B><I>constant </I></B><I>T: T;</I><B><I>                          </I></B><I> --  Illegal</I><B>

        </B><I>  </I><B><I>procedure</I></B> <I>P (X: P);</I><B><I>                    </I></B><I>  --  Illegal</I><B>

          </B><B><I>function</I></B><B> </B><I>Q (X: REAL := Q)</I> <I><B>return</B> Q;</I><B><I>    </I></B><I>  --  Illegal</I>

       <B>   procedure</B> R (R: REAL);                   --  Legal (although perhaps confusing)

<I>Example:</I></PRE><PRE>   L1:  <B>block</B>

               <B>signal</B> A,B: Bit ;

          <B>begin</B>

          L2:  <B>block</B>

                   <B>signal</B> B: Bit ;                           --  An inner homograph of B.

               <B>begin</B>

                   A &lt;= B <B>after</B> 5 ns;                        --  Means L1.A &lt;= L2.B

                   B &lt;= L1.B <B>after</B> 10 ns;                    --  Means L2.B &lt;= L1.B

               <B>end block</B> ;

                   B &lt;= A <B>after</B> 15 ns;                       --  Means L1.B &lt;= L1.A

          <B>end block</B> ;

</PRE>
<H2><A name=10.4></A><A 
href="1076_10.html#10.4">10.4 
</A>Use clauses</H2>
<P>A use clause achieves direct visibility of declarations that are visible by 
selection. </P><PRE>     use_clause ::=

         <B>use</B> selected_name { , selected_name } ;

</PRE>
<P>Each selected name in a use clause identifies one or more declarations that 
will potentially become directly visible. If the suffix of the selected name is 
a simple name, character literal, or operator symbol, then the selected name 
identifies only the declaration(s) of that simple name, character literal, or 
operator symbol contained within the package or library denoted by the prefix of 
the selected name. If the suffix is the reserved word <B>all</B>, then the 
selected name identifies all declarations that are contained within the package 
or library denoted by the prefix of the selected name. </P>
<P>For each use clause, there is a certain region of text called the 
<I>scope</I> of the use clause. This region starts immediately after the use 
clause. If a use clause is a declarative item of some declarative region, the 
scope of the clause extends to the end of the declarative region. If a use 
clause occurs within the context clause of a design unit, the scope of the use 
clause extends to the end of the declarative region associated with the design 
unit. The scope of a use clause may additionally extend into a configuration 
declaration(see <A 
href="1076_10.html#10.2">10.2 
</A>). </P>
<P>In order to determine which declarations are made directly visible at a given 
place by use clauses, consider the set of declarations identified by all use 
clauses whose scopes enclose this place. Any declaration in this set is a 
potentially visible declaration. A potentially visible declaration is actually 
made directly visible except in the following two cases: </P>
<OL type=a>
  <LI>A potentially visible declaration is not made directly visible if the 
  place considered is within the immediate scope of a homograph of the 
  declaration.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Potentially visible declarations that have the same designator are not 
  made directly visible unless each of them is either an enumeration literal 
  specification or the declaration of a subprogram (either by a subprogram 
  declaration or by an implicit declaration). </LI></OL>
<P>NOTES </P>
<P>1--These rules guarantee that a declaration that is made directly visible by 
a use clause cannot hide an otherwise directly visible declaration. </P>
<P>2--If a named entity X declared in package P is made potentially visible 
within a package Q (e.g., by the inclusion of the clause "<B>use</B> P.X;" in 
the context clause of package Q), and the context clause for design unit R 
includes the clause "<B>use</B> Q.<B>all</B>;", this does not imply that X will 
be potentially visible in R. Only those named entities that are actually 
declared in package Q will be potentially visible in design unit R (in the 
absence of any other use clauses). </P>
<H2><A name=10.5></A><A 
href="1076_10.html#10.5">10.5 
</A>The context of overload resolution</H2>
<P>Overloading is defined for names, subprograms, and enumeration literals. </P>
<P>For overloaded entities, overload resolution determines the actual meaning 
that an occurrence of an identifier or a character literal has whenever the 
visibility rules have determined that more than one meaning is acceptable at the 
place of this occurrence; overload resolution likewise determines the actual 
meaning of an occurrence of an operator or basic operation (see the introduction 
to Section 3). </P>
<P>At such a place, all visible declarations are considered. The occurrence is 
only legal if there is exactly one interpretation of each constituent of the 
innermost complete context; a <I>complete context</I> is either a declaration,a 
specification, or a statement. </P>
<P>When considering possible interpretations of a complete context, the only 
rules considered are the syntax rules, the scope and visibility rules, and the 
rules of the form described below. </P>
<OL type=a>
  <LI>Any rule that requires a name or expression to have a certain type or to 
  have the same type as another name or expression.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Any rule that requires the type of a name or expression to be a type of a 
  certain class; similarly, any rule that requires a certain type to be a 
  discrete, integer, floating point, physical, universal, character, or Boolean 
  type.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Any rule that requires a prefix to be appropriate for a certain type.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>The rules that require the type of an aggregate or string literal to be 
  determinable solely from the enclosing complete context. Similarly, the rules 
  that require the type of the prefix of an attribute, the type of the 
  expression of a case statement, or the type of the operand of a type 
  conversion to be determinable independently of the context.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>The rules given for the resolution of overloaded subprogram calls; for the 
  implicit conversions of universal expressions; for the interpretation of 
  discrete ranges with bounds having a universal type; and for the 
  interpretation of an expanded name whose prefix denotes a subprogram.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>The rules given for the requirements on the return type, the number of 
  formal parameters, and the types of the formal parameters of the subprogram 
  denoted by the resolution function name (see <A 
  href="1076_2.html#2.4">2.4 
  </A>). </LI></OL>
<P>NOTES </P>
<P>1--If there is only one possible interpretation of an occurrence of an 
identifier, character literal, operator symbol, or string, that occurrence 
denotes the corresponding named entity. However, this condition does not mean 
that the occurrence is necessarily legal since other requirements exist that are 
not considered for overload resolution: for example, the fact that the 
expression is static, the parameter modes, conformance rules, the use of named 
association in an indexed name, the use of <B>open</B> in an indexed name, the 
use of a slice as an actual to a function call, and so forth. </P>
<P>2--A loop parameter specification is a declaration, and hence a complete 
context. </P>
<P>3--Rules that require certain constructs to have the same parameter and 
result type profile fall under category a. The same holds for rules that require 
conformance of two constructs, since conformance requires that corresponding 
names be given the same meaning by the visibility and overloading rules. </P>
