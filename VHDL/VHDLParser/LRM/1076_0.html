<H1>Overview of this standard<BR></H1>
<P>This section describes the purpose and organization of this standard, the 
IEEE Standard VHDL Language Reference Manual (IEEE Std. 1076-1993). </P>
<H2><A name=0.1></A><A 
href="1076_0.html#0.1">0.1 
</A>Intent and scope of this document</H2>
<P>The intent of this standard is to define VHDL accurately. Its primary 
audiences are the implementor of tools supporting the language and the advanced 
user of the language. Other users are encouraged to use commercially available 
books, tutorials, and classes to learn the language in some detail prior to 
reading this manual. These resources generally focus on how to use the language, 
rather than how a VHDL-compliant tool is required to behave. </P>
<P>At the time of its publication, this document was the authoritative 
definition of VHDL. From time to time, it may become necessary to correct and/or 
clarify portions of this standard. Such corrections and clarifications may be 
published in separate documents. Such documents modify this standard at the time 
of their publication and remain in effect until superseded by subsequent 
documents or until the standard is officially revised. </P>

</A>Structure and terminology of this document</H2>
<P>This manual is organized into sections, each of which focuses on some 
particular area of the language. Every fifth line of each section, not including 
section headings, footers, and the section title, is numbered in the left 
margin. Within each section, individual constructs or concepts are discussed in 
each clause. </P>
<P>Each clause describing a specific construct begins with an introductory 
paragraph. Next, the syntax of the construct is described using one or more 
grammatical "productions." </P>
<P>A set of paragraphs describing the meaning and restrictions of the construct 
in narrative form then follow. Unlike many other IEEE standards, which use the 
verb "shall" to indicate mandatory requirements of the standard and "may" to 
indicate optional features, the verb "is" is used uniformly throughout this 
document. In all cases, "is" is to be interpreted as having mandatory weight. 
</P>
<P>Additionally, the word "must" is used to indicate mandatory weight. This word 
is preferred over the more common "shall," as "must" denotes a different meaning 
to different readers of this standard. </P>
<OL type=a>
  <LI>To the developer of tools that process VHDL, "must" denotes a requirement 
  that the standard imposes. The resulting implementation is required to enforce 
  the requirement and to issue an error if the requirement is not met by some 
  VHDL source text.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>To the VHDL model developer, "must" denotes that the characteristics of 
  VHDL are natural consequences of the language definition. The model developer 
  is required to adhere to the constraint implied by the characteristic.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>To the VHDL model user, "must" denotes that the characteristics of the 
  models are natural consequences of the language definition. The model user can 
  depend on the characteristics of the model implied by its VHDL source text. 
  </LI></OL>
<P>Finally, each clause may end with examples, notes, and references to other 
pertinent clauses. </P>

</A>Syntactic description</H3>
<P>The form of a VHDL description is described by means of context-free syntax, 
using a simple variant of backus naur form; in particular: </P>
<OL type=a>
  <LI>Lowercased words in roman font, some containing embedded underlines, are 
  used to denote syntactic categories, for example: <PRE>          formal_port_list

</PRE>
  <P>Whenever the name of a syntactic category is used, apart from the syntax 
  rules themselves, spaces take the place of underlines (thus, "formal port 
  list" would appear in the narrative description when referring to the above 
  syntactic category).<BR></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Boldface words are used to denote reserved words, for example: <PRE>          <B>array</B>

</PRE>
  <P>Reserved words must be used only in those places indicated by the syntax. 
  <BR></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A <I>production</I> consists of a <I>left-hand side</I>, the symbol 
  "::="(which is read as "can be replaced by"), and a <I>right-hand side</I>. 
  The left-hand side of a production is always a syntactic category; the 
  right-hand side is a replacement rule.<BR>
  <P>The meaning of a production is a textual-replacement rule: any occurrence 
  of the left-hand side may be replaced by an instance of the right-hand 
  side.<BR></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>A vertical bar separates alternative items on the right-hand side of a 
  production unless it occurs immediately after an opening brace, in which case 
  it stands for itself: <PRE>          letter_or_digit ::= letter | digit



          choices  ::=  choice { | choice }

</PRE>
  <P>In the first instance, an occurrence of "letter_or_digit" can be replaced 
  by either "letter" or "digit." In the second case, "choices" can be replaced 
  by a list of "choice," separated by vertical bars (see item f for the meaning 
  of braces).<BR></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Square brackets enclose optional items on the right-hand side of a 
  production; thus the two following productions are equivalent: <PRE>          return_statement ::= <B>return</B> [ expression ] ;



          return_statement ::= <B>return</B> ; | <B>return</B> expression ;

</PRE>
  <P>Note, however, that the initial and terminal square brackets in the 
  right-hand side of the production for signatures (in <A 
  href="1076_2.html#2.3.2">2.3.2 
  </A>) are part of the syntax of signatures and do not indicate that the entire 
  right-hand side is optional.<BR></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Braces enclose a repeated item or items on the right-hand side of a 
  production. The items may appear zero or more times; the repetitions occur 
  from left to right as with an equivalent left-recursive rule. Thus, the 
  following two productions are equivalent: <PRE>          term ::= factor { multiplying_operator factor }



          term ::= factor | term multiplying_operator factor

</PRE>
  <LI>If the name of any syntactic category starts with an italicized part, it 
  is equivalent to the category name without the italicized part. The italicized 
  part is intended to convey some semantic information. For example, 
  <I>type</I>_name and <I>subtype</I>_name are both syntactically equivalent to 
  name alone.<BR>
  <P></P>
  <LI>The term simple_name is used for any occurrence of an identifier that 
  already denotes some declared entity.<BR></LI></OL>
<H3><A name=0.2.2></A><A 
href="1076_0.html#0.2.2">0.2.2 
</A>Semantic description</H3>
<P>The meaning and restrictions of a particular construct are described with a 
set of narrative rules immediately following the syntactic productions. In these 
rules, an italicized term indicates the definition of that term and identifiers 
appearing entirely in uppercase refer to definitions in package STANDARD (see <A 
href="1076_14.html#14.2">14.2 
</A>). </P>
<P>The following terms are used in these semantic descriptions with the 
following meaning: </P><PRE>erroneous          The condition described represents an ill-formed description; implementations are however,

                   not required to detect and report this condition.



                   Conditions are deemed erroneous only when it is impossible in general to detect the condition

                   During The Processing Of The Language.



error              The condition described represents an ill-formed description; implementations are required to

                   detect the condition and report an error to the user of the tool.



illegal            A synonym for "error."



legal              The condition described represents a well-formed description.

</A>Front matter, examples, notes, references, and annexes</H3>
<P>Prior to this section are several pieces of introductory material; following 
the final section are some annexes and an index. The front matter, annexes,and 
index serve to orient and otherwise aid the user of this manual but are not part 
of the definition of VHDL. </P>
<P>Some clauses of this standard contain examples, notes, and cross-references 
to other clauses of the manual; these parts always appear at the end of a 
clause. Examples are meant to illustrate the possible forms of the construct 
described. Illegal examples are italicized. Notes are meant to emphasize 
consequences of the rules described in the clause or elsewhere. In order to 
distinguish notes from the other narrative portions of this standard, notes are 
set as enumerated paragraphs in a font smaller than the rest of the text. 
Cross-references are meant to guide the user to other relevant clauses of the 
manual. Examples, notes, and cross-references are not part of the definition of 
the language. </P>
