<H1>Design units and their analysis </H1>
<P>The overall organization of descriptions, as well as their analysis and 
subsequent definition in a design library, are discussed in this section. </P>

href="1076_11.html#11.1">11.1 
</A>Design units</H2>
<P>Certain constructs may be independently analyzed and inserted into a design 
library; these constructs are called <I>design units</I>. One or more design 
units in sequence comprise a <I>design file</I>. </P><PRE>     design_file ::=  design_unit { design_unit }



     design_unit ::=  context_clause library_unit



     library_unit ::=

            primary_unit

         | secondary_unit



     primary_unit ::=

            entity_declaration

         | configuration_declaration

         | package_declaration



     secondary_unit ::=

            architecture_body

         | package_body

</PRE>
<P>Design units in a design file are analyzed in the textual order of their 
appearance in the design file. Analysis of a design unit defines the 
corresponding library unit in a design library. A <I>library unit</I> is either 
a primary unit or a secondary unit. A secondary unit is a separately analyzed 
body of a primary unit resulting from a previous analysis. </P>
<P>The name of a primary unit is given by the first identifier after the initial 
reserved word of that unit. Of the secondary units, only architecture bodies are 
named; the name of an architecture body is given by the identifier following the 
reserved word <B>architecture</B>. Each primary unit in a given library must 
have a simple name that is unique within the given library, and each 
architecture body associated with a given entity declaration must have a simple 
name that is unique within the set of names of the architecture bodies 
associated with that entity declaration. </P>
<P>Entity declarations, architecture bodies, and configuration declarations are 
discussed in Section 1. Package declarations and package bodies are discussed in 
Section 2. </P>

</A>Design libraries </H2>
<P>A <I>design library</I> is an implementation-dependent storage facility for 
previously analyzed design units. A given implementation is required to support 
any number of design libraries. </P><PRE>     library_clause  ::=  <B>library</B> logical_name_list ;



     logical_name_list  ::=  logical_name { , logical_name }



     logical_name  ::=  identifier

</PRE>
<P>A library clause defines logical names for design libraries in the host 
environment. A library clause appears as part of a context clause at the 
beginning of a design unit. There is a certain region of text called the<I> 
scope</I> of a library clause; this region starts immediately after the library 
clause, and it extends to the end of the declarative region associated with the 
design unit in which the library clause appears. Within this scope each logical 
name defined by the library clause is directly visible, except where hidden in 
an inner declarative region by a homograph of the logical name according to the 
rules of <A 
href="1076_10.html#10.3">10.3 
</A>. </P>
<P>If two or more logical names having the same identifier (see <A 
href="1076_13.html#13.3">13.3 
</A>) appear in library clauses in the same context clause, the second and 
subsequent occurrences of the logical name have no effect. The same is true of 
logical names appearing both in the context clause of a primary unit and in the 
context clause of a corresponding secondary unit. </P>
<P>Each logical name defined by the library clause denotes a design library in 
the host environment. </P>
<P>For a given library logical name, the actual name of the corresponding design 
libraries in the host environment may or may not be the same. A given 
implementation must provide some mechanism to associate a library logical name 
with a host-dependent library. Such a mechanism is not defined by the language. 
</P>
<P>There are two classes of design libraries: working libraries and resource 
libraries. A <I>working library</I> is the library into which the library unit 
resulting from the analysis of a design unit is placed. A <I>resource 
library</I> is a library containing library units that are referenced within the 
design unit being analyzed. Only one library may be the working library during 
the analysis of any given design unit; in contrast, any number of libraries 
(including the working library itself) may be resource libraries during such an 
analysis. </P>
<P>Every design unit except package STANDARD is assumed to contain the following 
implicit context items as part of its context clause: </P><PRE>    <B> library</B> STD, WORK ; <B>use</B> STD.STANDARD.<B>all</B> ;

</PRE>
<P>Library logical name STD denotes the design library in which package STANDARD 
and package TEXTIO reside; these are the only standard packages defined by the 
language (see Section 14). (The use clause makes all declarations within package 
STANDARD directly visible within the corresponding design unit; see <A 
href="1076_10.html#10.4">10.4 
</A>). Library logical name WORK denotes the current working library during a 
given analysis. </P>
<P>The library denoted by the library logical name STD contains no library units 
other than package STANDARD and package TEXTIO. </P>
<P>A secondary unit corresponding to a given primary unit may only be placed 
into the design library in which the primary unit resides. </P>
<P>NOTE--The design of the language assumes that the contents of resource 
libraries named in all library clauses in the context clause of a design unit 
will remain unchanged during the analysis of that unit (with the possible 
exception of the updating of the library unit corresponding to the analyzed 
design unit within the working library, if that library is also a resource 
library). </P>
<H2><A name=11.3></A><A 
href="1076_11.html#11.3">11.3 
</A>Context clauses </H2>
<P>A context clause defines the initial name environment in which a design unit 
is analyzed. </P><PRE>     context_clause ::=  { context_item }



     context_item  ::=

           library_clause

         | use_clause

</PRE>
<P>A library clause defines library logical names that may be referenced in the 
design unit; library clauses are described in <A 
href="1076_11.html#11.2">11.2 
</A>. A use clause makes certain declarations directly visible within the design 
unit; use clauses are described in <A 
href="1076_10.html#10.4">10.4 
</A>. </P>
<P>NOTE--The rules given for use clauses are such that the same effect is 
obtained whether the name of a library unit is mentioned once or more than once 
by the applicable use clauses, or even within a given use clause. </P>
<H2><A name=11.4></A><A 
href="1076_11.html#11.4">11.4 
</A>Order of analysis </H2>
<P>The rules defining the order in which design units can be analyzed are direct 
consequences of the visibility rules. In particular: </P>
<OL type=a>
  <LI>A primary unit whose name is referenced within a given design unit must be 
  analyzed prior to the analysis of the given design unit.<BR>
  <LI>A primary unit must be analyzed prior to the analysis of any corresponding 
  secondary unit. </LI></OL>
<P>In each case, the second unit <I>depends on</I> the first unit. </P>
<P>The order in which design units are analyzed must be consistent with the 
partial ordering defined by the above rules. </P>
<P>If any error is detected while attempting to analyze a design unit, then the 
attempted analysis is rejected and has no effect whatsoever on the current 
working library. </P>
<P>A given library unit is potentially affected by a change in any library unit 
whose name is referenced within the given library unit. A secondary unit is 
potentially affected by a change in its corresponding primary unit. If a library 
unit is changed (e.g., by reanalysis of the corresponding design unit),then all 
library units that are potentially affected by such a change become obsolete and 
must be reanalyzed before they can be used again. </P>
