<H1>Declarations</H1>
<P>The language defines several kinds of entities that are declared explicitly 
or implicitly by declarations. </P><PRE>     declaration ::=

           type_declaration

         | subtype_declaration

         | object_declaration

         | interface_declaration

         | alias_declaration

         | attribute_declaration

         | component_declaration

         | group_template_declaration

         | group_declaration

         | entity_declaration

         | configuration_declaration

         | subprogram_declaration

         | package_declaration

</PRE>
<P>For each form of declaration, the language rules define a certain region of 
text called the <I>scope</I> of the declaration (see <A 
href="1076_10.html#10.2">10.2 
</A>). Each form of declaration associates an identifier with a named entity. 
Only within its scope, there are places where it is possible to use the 
identifier to refer to the associated declared entity; these places are defined 
by the visibility rules (see <A 
href="1076_10.html#10.3">10.3 
</A>). At such places the identifier is said to be a <I>name</I> of the entity; 
the name is said to <I>denote</I> the associated entity. </P>
<P>This section describes type and subtype declarations, the various kinds of 
object declarations, alias declarations, attribute declarations, component 
declarations, and group and group template declarations. The other kinds of 
declarations are described in Section 1 and Section 2. </P>
<P>A declaration takes effect through the process of elaboration. Elaboration of 
declarations is discussed in Section 12. </P>
<H2><A name=4.1></A><A 
href="1076_4.html#4.1">4.1 
</A>Type declarations</H2>
<P>A type declaration declares a type. </P><PRE>     type_declaration ::=

          full_type_declaration

        | incomplete_type_declaration



     full_type_declaration ::=

          <B>type</B> identifier <B>is</B> type_definition ;



     type_definition ::=

          scalar_type_definition

        | composite_type_definition

        | access_type_definition

        | file_type_definition

</PRE>
<P>The types created by the elaboration of distinct type definitions are 
distinct types. The elaboration of the type definition for a scalar type or a 
constrained array type creates both a base type and a subtype of the base type. 
</P>
<P>The simple name declared by a type declaration denotes the declared 
type,unless the type declaration declares both a base type and a subtype of the 
base type, in which case the simple name denotes the subtype and the base type 
is anonymous. A type is said to be <I>anonymous</I> if it has no simple name. 
For explanatory purposes, this standard sometimes refers to an anonymous type by 
a pseudo-name, written in italics, and uses such pseudo-names at places where 
the syntax normally requires an identifier. </P>
<H4>NOTES</H4>
<P>1--Two type definitions always define two distinct types, even if they are 
lexically identical. Thus, the type definitions in the following two integer 
type declarations define distinct types: </P><PRE>     <B>type</B> A <B>is range</B> 1 <B>to</B> 10;

     <B>type</B> B <B>is range</B> 1 <B>to</B> 10;

</PRE>
<P>This applies to type declarations for other classes of types as well. </P>
<P>2--The various forms of type definition are described in Section 3. Examples 
of type declarations are also given in that section. </P>
<H2><A name=4.2></A><A 
href="1076_4.html#4.2">4.2 
</A>Subtype declarations</H2>
<P>A subtype declaration declares a subtype. </P><PRE>     subtype_declaration ::=

         <B>subtype</B> identifier <B>is</B> subtype_indication ;



     subtype_indication ::=

         [ <I>resolution_function</I>_name ] type_mark [ constraint ]



     type_mark ::=

           <I>type</I>_name

         | <I>subtype</I>_name



     constraint ::=

           range_constraint

         | index_constraint

</PRE>
<P>A type mark denotes a type or a subtype. If a type mark is the name of a 
type,the type mark denotes this type and also the corresponding unconstrained 
subtype. The base type of a type mark is, by definition, the base type of the 
type or subtype denoted by the type mark. </P>
<P>A subtype indication defines a subtype of the base type of the type mark. 
</P>
<P>If a subtype indication includes a resolution function name, then any signal 
declared to be of that subtype will be resolved, if necessary, by the named 
function (see <A 
href="1076_2.html#2.4">2.4 
</A>); for an overloaded function name, the meaning of the function name is 
determined by context (see <A 
href="1076_2.html#2.3">2.3 
</A>and <A 
href="1076_10.html#10.5">10.5 
</A>). It is an error if the function does not meet the requirements of a 
resolution function (see <A 
href="1076_2.html#2.4">2.4 
</A>).The presence of a resolution function name has no effect on the 
declarations of objects other than signals or on the declarations of files, 
aliases,attributes, or other subtypes. </P>
<P>If the subtype indication does not include a constraint, the subtype is the 
same as that denoted by the type mark. The condition imposed by a constraint is 
the condition obtained after evaluation of the expressions and ranges forming 
the constraint. The rules defining compatibility are given for each form of 
constraint in the appropriate section. These rules are such that if a constraint 
is compatible with a subtype, then the condition imposed by the constraint 
cannot contradict any condition already imposed by the subtype on its values. An 
error occurs if any check of compatibility fails. </P>
<P>The direction of a discrete subtype indication is the same as the direction 
of the range constraint that appears as the constraint of the subtype 
indication. If no constraint is present, and the type mark denotes a subtype, 
the direction of the subtype indication is the same as that of the denoted 
subtype. If no constraint is present, and the type mark denotes a type, the 
direction of the subtype indication is the same as that of the range used to 
define the denoted type. The direction of a discrete subtype is the same as the 
direction of its subtype indication. </P>
<P>A subtype indication denoting an access type or a file type may not contain 
are solution function. Furthermore, the only allowable constraint on a subtype 
indication denoting an access type is an index constraint (and then only if the 
designated type is an array type). </P>
<P>NOTE--A subtype declaration does not define a new type. </P>

</A>Objects</H2>
<P>An <I>object</I> is a named entity that contains (has) a value of a given 
type. An object is one of the following: </P>
<P>-- An object declared by an object declaration (see <A 
href="1076_4.html#4.3.1">4.3.1 
</A>) </P>
<P>-- A loop or generate parameter (see <A 
href="1076_8.html#8.9">8.9 
</A>and <A 
href="1076_9.html#9.7">9.7 
</A>) </P>
<P>-- A formal parameter of a subprogram (see <A 
href="1076_2.html#2.1.1">2.1.1 
</A>) </P>
<P>-- A formal port (see <A 
href="1076_1.html#1.1.1.2">1.1.1.2 
</A>and <A 
href="1076_9.html#9.1">9.1 
</A>) </P>
<P>-- A formal generic (see <A 
href="1076_1.html#1.1.1.1">1.1.1.1 
</A>and <A 
href="1076_9.html#9.1">9.1 
</A>) </P>
<P>-- A local port (see <A 
href="1076_4.html#4.5">4.5 
</A>) </P>
<P>-- A local generic (see <A 
href="1076_4.html#4.5">4.5 
</A>) </P>
<P>-- An implicit signal GUARD defined by the guard expression of a block 
statement (see <A 
href="1076_9.html#9.1">9.1 
</A>) </P>
<P>In addition, the following are objects, but are not named entities: </P>
<P>-- An implicit signal defined by any of the predefined attributes 
'DELAYED,'STABLE, 'QUIET, and 'TRANSACTION (see <A 
href="1076_14.html#14.1">14.1 
</A>) </P>
<P>-- An element or slice of another object (see <A 
href="1076_6.html#6.3">6.3 
</A>, <A 
href="1076_6.html#6.4">6.4 
</A>, and <A 
href="1076_6.html#6.5">6.5 
</A>) </P>
<P>-- An object designated by a value of an access type (see <A 
href="1076_3.html#3.3">3.3 
</A>) </P>
<P>There are four classes of objects: constants, signals, variables, and files. 
The variable class of objects also has an additional subclass: shared variables. 
The class of an explicitly declared object is specified by the reserved word 
that must or may appear at the beginning of the declaration of that object. For 
a given object of a composite type, each subelement of that object is itself an 
object of the same class and subclass, if any, as the given object. The value of 
a composite object is the aggregation of the values of its subelements. </P>
<P>Objects declared by object declarations are available for use within 
blocks,processes, subprograms, or packages. Loop and generate parameters are 
implicitly declared by the corresponding statement and are available for use 
only within that statement. Other objects, declared by interface 
declarations,create channels for the communication of values between independent 
parts of a description. </P>
<H3><A name=4.3.1></A><A 
href="1076_4.html#4.3.1">4.3.1 
</A>Object declarations</H3>
<P>An object declaration declares an object of a specified type. Such an object 
is called an <I>explicitly declared object</I>. </P><PRE>     object_declaration ::=

           constant_declaration

         | signal_declaration

         | variable_declaration

         | file_declaration

</PRE>
<P>An object declaration is called a <I>single-object declaration</I> if its 
identifier list has a single identifier; it is called a <I>multiple-object 
declaration</I> if the identifier list has two or more identifiers. A 
multiple-object declaration is equivalent to a sequence of the corresponding 
number of single-object declarations. For each identifier of the list, the 
equivalent sequence has a single-object declaration formed by this 
identifier,followed by a colon and by whatever appears at the right of the colon 
in the multiple-object declaration; the equivalent sequence is in the same order 
as the identifier list. </P>
<P>A similar equivalence applies also for interface object declarations (see <A 
href="1076_4.html#4.3.2">4.3.2 
</A>). </P>
<P>NOTE--The subelements of a composite, declared object are not declared 
objects. </P>
<H4><A name=4.3.1.1></A><A 
href="1076_4.html#4.3.1.1">4.3.1.1 
</A>Constant declarations</H4>
<P>A constant declaration declares a <I>constant</I> of the specified type. Such 
a constant is an <I>explicitly declared constant</I>. </P><PRE>     constant_declaration ::=

         <B>constant</B> identifier_list : subtype_indication [ := expression ] ;

</PRE>
<P>If the assignment symbol ":=" followed by an expression is present in a 
constant declaration, the expression specifies the value of the constant; the 
type of the expression must be that of the constant. The value of a constant 
cannot be modified after the declaration is elaborated. </P>
<P>If the assignment symbol ":=" followed by an expression is not present in a 
constant declaration, then the declaration declares a <I>deferred</I> 
<I>constant</I>. Such a constant declaration may only appear in a package 
declaration. The corresponding full constant declaration, which defines the 
value of the constant, must appear in the body of the package (see <A 
href="1076_2.html#2.6">2.6 
</A>). </P>
<P>Formal parameters of subprograms that are of mode <B>in</B> may be 
constants,and local and formal generics are always constants; the declarations 
of such objects are discussed in <A 
href="1076_4.html#4.3.2">4.3.2 
</A>. A loop parameter is a constant within the corresponding loop (see <A 
href="1076_8.html#8.9">8.9 
</A>); similarly, a generate parameter is a constant within the corresponding 
generate statement (see <A 
href="1076_9.html#9.7">9.7 
</A>). A subelement or slice of a constant is a constant. </P>
<P>It is an error if a constant declaration declares a constant that is of a 
file type, an access type, or a composite type that has a subelement that is a 
file type or an access type. </P>
<P>NOTE--The subelements of a composite, declared constant are not declared 
constants. </P>
<P><I>Examples:</I> </P><PRE>     <B>constant</B> TOLERANCE : DISTANCE := 1.5 nm;

     <B>constant</B> PI : REAL := 3.141592;

     <B>constant</B> CYCLE_TIME : TIME := 100 ns;

     <B>constant</B> Propagation_Delay : DELAY_LENGTH;   -- a deferred constant

href="1076_4.html#4.3.1.2">4.3.1.2 
</A>Signal declarations</H4>
<P>A signal declaration declares a <I>signal</I> of the specified type. Such a 
signal is an <I>explicitly declared signal</I>. </P><PRE>     signal_declaration ::=

         <B>signal</B> identifier_list : subtype_indication [ signal_kind ] [ := expression ] ;



     signal_kind ::=  <B>register</B>  |  <B>bus</B>

</PRE>
<P>If the name of a resolution function appears in the declaration of a signal 
or in the declaration of the subtype used to declare the signal, then that 
resolution function is associated with the declared signal. Such a signal is 
called a <I>resolved</I> <I>signal</I>. </P>
<P>If a signal kind appears in a signal declaration, then the signals so 
declared are <I>guarded</I> signals of the kind indicated. For a guarded signal 
that is of a composite type, each subelement is likewise a guarded signal. For a 
guarded signal that is of an array type, each slice (see <A 
href="1076_6.html#6.5">6.5 
</A>) is likewise a guarded signal. A guarded signal may be assigned values 
under the control of Boolean-valued <I>guard expressions</I> (or <I>guards</I>). 
</P>
<P>When a given guard becomes False, the drivers of the corresponding guarded 
signals are implicitly assigned a null transaction (see <A 
href="1076_8.html#8.4.1">8.4.1 
</A>) to cause those drivers to turn off. A disconnection specification (see <A 
href="1076_5.html#5.3">5.3 
</A>) is used to specify the time required for those drivers to turn off. </P>
<P>If the signal declaration includes the assignment symbol followed by an 
expression, it must be of the same type as the signal. Such an expression is 
said to be a <I>default expression</I>. The default expression defines a 
<I>default value</I> associated with the signal or, for a composite signal,with 
each scalar subelement thereof. For a signal declared to be of a scalar subtype, 
the value of the default expression is the default value of the signal. For a 
signal declared to be of a composite subtype, each scalar subelement of the 
value of the default expression is the default value of the corresponding 
subelement of the signal. </P>
<P>In the absence of an explicit default expression, an implicit default value 
is assumed for a signal of a scalar subtype or for each scalar subelement of a 
composite signal, each of which is itself a signal of a scalar subtype. The 
implicit default value for a signal of a scalar subtype T is defined to be that 
given by T'LEFT. </P>
<P>It is an error if a signal declaration declares a signal that is of a file 
type or an access type. It is also an error if a guarded signal of a scalar type 
is neither a resolved signal nor a subelement of a resolved signal. </P>
<P>A signal may have one or more <I>sources</I>. For a signal of a scalar 
type,each source is either a driver (see <A 
href="1076_12.html#12.6.1">12.6.1 
</A>) or an <B>out</B>, <B>inout</B>,<B>buffer</B>, or <B>linkage</B> port of a 
component instance or of a block statement with which the signal is associated. 
For a signal of a composite type, each composite source is a collection of 
scalar sources, one for each scalar subelement of the signal. It is an error if, 
after the elaboration of a description, a signal has multiple sources and it is 
not a resolved signal. It is also an error if, after the elaboration of a 
description, a resolved signal has more sources than the number of elements in 
the index range of the type of the formal parameter of the resolution function 
associated with the resolved signal. </P>
<P>If a subelement or slice of a resolved signal of composite type is associated 
as an actual in a port map aspect (either in a component instantiation statement 
or in a binding indication), and if the corresponding formal is of mode 
<B>out</B>, <B>inout</B>, <B>buffer</B>, or <B>linkage</B>, then every scalar 
subelement of that signal must be associated exactly once with such a formal in 
the same port map aspect, and the collection of the corresponding formal parts 
taken together constitute one source of the signal. If a resolved signal of 
composite type is associated as an actual in a port map aspect, that is 
equivalent to each of its subelements being associated in the same port map 
aspect. </P>
<P>If a subelement of a resolved signal of composite type has a driver in a 
given process, then every scalar subelement of that signal must have a driver in 
the same process, and the collection of all of those drivers taken together 
constitute one source of the signal. </P>
<P>The default value associated with a scalar signal defines the value component 
of a transaction that is the initial contents of each driver (if any) of that 
signal. The time component of the transaction is not defined, but the 
transaction is understood to have already occurred by the start of simulation.

</PRE>
<H4>NOTES</H4>
<P>1--Ports of any mode are also signals. The term <I>signal</I> is used in this 
standard to refer to objects declared either by signal declarations or by port 
declarations (or to subelements, slices, or aliases of such objects). It also 
refers to the implicit signal GUARD (see <A 
href="1076_9.html#9.1">9.1 
</A>) and to implicit signals defined by the predefined attributes 'DELAYED, 
'STABLE, 'QUIET, and 'TRANSACTION. The term <I>port</I> is used to refer to 
objects declared by port declarations only. </P>
<P>2--Signals are given initial values by initializing their drivers. The 
initial values of drivers are then propagated through the corresponding net to 
determine the initial values of the signals that make up the net (see <A 
href="1076_12.html#12.6.3">12.6.3 
</A>). </P>
<P>3--The value of a signal may be indirectly modified by a signal assignment 
statement (see <A 
href="1076_8.html#8.4">8.4 
</A>); such assignments affect the future values of the signal. </P>
<P>4--The subelements of a composite, declared signal are not declared signals.

</A>Variable declarations</H4>
<P>A variable declaration declares a <I>variable</I> of the specified type. Such 
a variable is an <I>explicitly declared variable</I>. </P><PRE>    variable_declaration ::=

        [ <B>shared</B> ] <B>variable</B> identifier_list : subtype_indication [ := expression ] ;

</PRE>
<P>A variable declaration that includes the reserved word <B>shared</B> is a 
<I>shared variable declaration</I>. A shared variable declaration declares a 
<I>shared variable</I>. Shared variables are a subclass of the variable class of 
objects. More than one process may access a given shared variable; however,if 
more than one process accesses a given shared variable during the same 
simulation cycle (see <A 
href="1076_12.html#12.6.4">12.6.4 
</A>), neither the value of the shared variable after the access nor the value 
read from the shared variable is defined by the language. A description is 
erroneous if it depends on whether or how an implementation sequentializes 
access to shared variables. </P>
<P>If the variable declaration includes the assignment symbol followed by an 
expression, the expression specifies an initial value for the declared variable; 
the type of the expression must be that of the variable. Such an expression is 
said to be an <I>initial value expression</I>. </P>
<P>If an initial value expression appears in the declaration of a variable, then 
the initial value of the variable is determined by that expression each time the 
variable declaration is elaborated. In the absence of an initial value 
expression, a default initial value applies. The default initial value for a 
/variable of a scalar subtype T is defined to be the value given by T'LEFT. The 
default initial value of a variable of a composite type is defined to be the 
aggregate of the default initial values of all of its scalar subelements, each 
of which is itself a variable of a scalar subtype. The default initial value of 
a variable of an access type is defined to be the value <B>null</B> for that 
type. </P>
<H4>NOTES</H4>
<P>1--The value of a variable may be modified by a variable assignment statement 
(see <A 
href="1076_8.html#8.5">8.5 
</A>); such assignments take effect immediately. </P>
<P>2--The variables declared within a given procedure persist until that 
procedure completes and returns to the caller. For procedures that contain wait 
statements, a variable may therefore persist from one point in simulation time 
to another, and the value in the variable is thus maintained over time. For 
processes, which never complete, all variables persist from the beginning of 
simulation until the end of simulation. </P>
<P>3--The subelements of a composite, declared variable are not declared 
variables. </P>
<P>4--Since the language does not guarantee the synchronization of accesses to 
shared variables by multiple processes in the same simulation cycle, the use of 
shared variables in this manner is non portable and nondeterministic. For 
example, consider the following architecture: </P><PRE>     <B>architecture</B> UseSharedVariables <B>of</B> SomeEntity is

         <B>subtype</B> ShortRange <B>is</B> INTEGER <B>range</B> 0 <B>to</B> 1;

         <B>shared</B> <B>variable</B> Counter: ShortRange := 0;



     <B>begin</B>

     PROC1: <B>process</B>

        <B>begin</B>

            Counter := Counter + 1;     -- The subtype check may or may not fail.

            <B>wait</B>;

        <B>end</B> <B>process</B> PROC1;



      PROC2: <B>process</B>

        <B>begin</B>

            Counter := Counter - 1;     -- The subtype check may or may not fail.

        <B>end</B> <B>process</B> PROC2;

<B>     end</B> <B>architecture</B> UseSharedVariables;

</PRE>
<P>In particular, the value of Counter after the execution of both processes is 
not guaranteed to be either 0 or 1, even if Counter is declared to be of type 
INTEGER. </P>
<P>5--Variables declared immediately within entity declarations, architecture 
bodies, packages, package bodies, and blocks must be shared variables. Variables 
declared immediately within subprograms and processes must not be shared 
variables. </P>
<P><I>Examples:</I> </P><PRE>     <B>variable</B> INDEX : INTEGER <B>range</B> 0 <B>to</B> 99 := 0 ;

<P>A file declaration declares a <I>file</I> of the specified type. Such a file

</PRE>
<P>The subtype indication of a file declaration must define a file subtype. </P>
<P>If file open information is included in a given file declaration, then the 
file declared by the declaration is opened (see <A 
href="1076_3.html#3.4.1">3.4.1 
</A>) with an implicit call to FILE_OPEN when the file declaration is elaborated 
(see <A 
href="1076_12.html#12.3.1.4">12.3.1.4 
</A>). This implicit call is to the FILE_OPEN procedure of the first form, and 
it associates the identifier with the file parameter F, the file logical name 
with the External_Name parameter, and the file open kind expression with the 
Open_Kind parameter. If a file open kind expression is not included in the file 
open information of a given file declaration, then the default value of 
READ_MODE is used during elaboration of the file declaration. </P>
<P>If file open information is not included in a given file declaration, then 
the file declared by the declaration is not opened when the file declaration is 
elaborated. </P>
<P>The file logical name must be an expression of predefined type STRING. The 
value of this expression is interpreted as a logical name for a file in the host 
system environment. An implementation must provide some mechanism to associate a 
file logical name with a host-dependent file. Such a mechanism is not defined by 
the language. </P>
<P>The file logical name identifies an external file in the host file system 
that is associated with the file object. This association provides a mechanism 
for either importing data contained in an external file into the design during 
simulation or exporting data generated during simulation to an external file. 
</P>
<P>If multiple file objects are associated with the same external file, and each 
file object has an access mode that is read-only (see <A 
href="1076_3.html#3.4.1">3.4.1 
</A>), then values read from each file object are read from the external file 
associated with the file object. The language does not define the order in which 
such values are read from the external file, nor does it define whether each 
value is read once or multiple times (once per file object). </P>
<P>The language does not define the order of and the relationship, if any, 
between values read from and written to multiple file objects that are 
associated with the same external file. An implementation may restrict the 
number of file objects that may be associated at one time with a given external 
file. </P>
<P>If a formal subprogram parameter is of the class <B>file</B>, it must be 
associated with an actual that is a file object. </P>

<P>If no mode is explicitly given in an interface declaration other than an

<P>For an interface file declaration, it is an error if the subtype indication 
does not denote a subtype of a file type. </P>
<P>If an interface signal declaration includes the reserved word <B>bus</B>, 
then the signal declared by that interface declaration is a guarded signal of

<P>If an interface declaration contains a ":=" symbol followed by an

<P>-- The interface object is a formal signal parameter </P>
<P>-- The interface object is a formal variable parameter of mode other than 
<B>in</B>. </P>
<P>In an interface signal declaration appearing in a port list, the default 
expression defines the default value(s) associated with the interface signal or

determine the initial contents of drivers, if any, of the interface signal as 
specified for signal declarations. </P>
<P>An interface object provides a channel of communication between the 
environment and a particular portion of a description. The value of an interface 
object may be determined by the value of an associated object or expression in 
the environment; similarly, the value of an object in the environment may be 
determined by the value of an associated interface object. The manner in which

<P>Each association element in an association list associates one actual 
designator with the corresponding interface element in the interface list of a 
subprogram declaration, component declaration, entity declaration, or block 
statement. The corresponding interface element is determined either by position 
or by name. </P>
<P>An association element is said to be <I>named</I> if the formal designator 
appears explicitly; otherwise, it is said to be <I>positional</I>. For a 
positional association, an actual designator at a given position in an 
association list corresponds to the interface element at the same position in 
the interface list. </P>
<P>Named associations can be given in any order, but if both positional and 
named associations appear in the same association list, then all positional 
associations must occur first at their normal position. Hence once a named 
association is used, the rest of the association list must use only named 
associations. </P>
<P>In the following, the term <I>actual</I> refers to an actual designator, and 
the term <I>formal</I> refers to a formal designator. </P>
<P>The formal part of a named element association may be in the form of a 
function call, where the single argument of the function is the formal 
designator itself, if and only if the mode of the formal is <B>out</B>, 
<B>inout</B>,<B>buffer</B>, or <B>linkage</B>, and if the actual is not 
<B>open</B>. In this case, the function name must denote a function whose single 
parameter is of the type of the formal and whose result is the type of the 
corresponding actual. Such a <I>conversion function</I> provides for type 
conversion in the event that data flows from the formal to the actual. </P>
<P>Alternatively, the formal part of a named element association may be in the 
form of a type conversion, where the expression to be converted is the formal 
designator itself, if and only if the mode of the formal is 
<B>out</B>,<B>inout</B>, <B>buffer</B>, or <B>linkage</B>, and if the actual is 
not <B>open</B>. In this case, the base type denoted by the type mark must be 
the same as the base type of the corresponding actual. Such a type conversion 
provides for type conversion in the event that data flows from the formal to the 
actual. It is an error if the type of the formal is not closely related to the 
type of the actual. (See <A 
href="1076_7.html#7.3.5">7.3.5 
</A>.) </P>
<P>Similarly, the actual part of a (named or positional) element association 
maybe in the form of a function call, where the single argument of the function 
is the actual designator itself, if and only if the mode of the formal is 
<B>in</B>, <B>inout</B>, or <B>linkage</B>, and if the actual is not 
<B>open</B>. In this case, the function name must denote a function whose single 
parameter is of the type of the actual, and whose result is the type of the 
corresponding formal. In addition, the formal must not be of class 
<B>constant</B> for this interpretation to hold (the actual is interpreted as an 
expression that is a function call if the class of the formal is 
<B>constant</B>). Such a conversion function provides for type conversion in the 
event that data flows from the actual to the formal. </P>
<P>Alternatively, the actual part of a (named or positional) element association 
may be in the form of a type conversion, where the expression to be type 
converted is the actual designator itself, if and only if the mode of the formal 
is <B>in</B>, <B>inout</B>, or <B>linkage</B>, and if the actual is not 
<B>open</B>. In this case, the base type denoted by the type mark must be the 
same as the base type of the corresponding formal. Such a type conversion 
provides for type conversion in the event that data flows from the actual to the 
formal. It is an error if the type of the actual is not closely related to the 
type of the formal. </P>
<P>The type of the actual (after applying the conversion function or type 
conversion, if present in the actual part) must be the same as the type of the 
corresponding formal, if the mode of the formal is <B>in</B>, <B>inout</B>, or 
<B>linkage</B>, and if the actual is not <B>open</B>. Similarly, if the mode of 
the formal is <B>out</B>, <B>inout</B>, <B>buffer</B>, or <B>linkage</B>, and if 
the actual is not <B>open</B>, then the type of the formal (after applying the 
conversion function or type conversion, if present in the formal part) must be 
the same as the corresponding actual. </P>
<P>For the association of signals with corresponding formal ports, association 
of a formal of a given composite type with an actual of the same type is 
equivalent to the association of each scalar subelement of the formal with the 
matching subelement of the actual, provided that no conversion function or type 
conversion is present in either the actual part or the formal part of the 
association element. If a conversion function or type conversion is present,then 
the entire formal is considered to be associated with the entire actual. </P>
<P>Similarly, for the association of actuals with corresponding formal 
subprogram parameters, association of a formal parameter of a given composite 
type with an actual of the same type is equivalent to the association of each 
scalar subelement of the formal parameter with the matching subelement of the 
actual. Different parameter passing mechanisms may be required in each case, but 
in both cases the associations will have an equivalent effect. This equivalence 
applies provided that no actual is accessible by more than one path (see <A 
href="1076_2.html#2.1.1.1">2.1.1.1 
</A>). </P>
<P>A formal may be either an explicitly declared interface object or member (see 
<A 
href="1076_3.html">Section 
3</A>) of such an interface object. In the former case,such a formal is said to 
be <I>associated in whole</I>. In the latter cases,named association must be 
used to associate the formal and actual; the subelements of such a formal are 
said to be <I>associated individually</I>. Furthermore, every scalar subelement 
of the explicitly declared interface object must be associated exactly once with 
an actual (or subelement thereof)in the same association list, and all such 
associations must appear in a contiguous sequence within that association list. 
Each association element that associates a slice or subelement (or slice 
thereof) of an interface object must identify the formal with a locally static 
name. </P>
<P>If an interface element in an interface list includes a default expression 
fora formal generic, for a formal port of any mode other than <B>linkage</B>, or 
for a formal variable or constant parameter of mode <B>in</B>, then any 
corresponding association list need not include an association element for that 
interface element. If the association element is not included in the association 
list, or if the actual is <B>open</B>, then the value of the default expression 
is used as the actual expression or signal value in an implicit association 
element for that interface element. </P>
<P>It is an error if an actual of <B>open</B> is associated with a formal that 
is associated individually. An actual of <B>open</B> counts as the single 
association allowed for the corresponding formal but does not supply a constant, 
signal, or variable (as is appropriate to the object class of the formal) to the 
formal. </P>
<H4>NOTES</H4>
<P>1--It is a consequence of these rules that, if an association element is 
omitted from an association list in order to make use of the default expression 
on the corresponding interface element, all subsequent association elements in 
that association list must be named associations. </P>
<P>2--Although a default expression can appear in an interface element that 
declares a (local or formal) port, such a default expression is not interpreted 
as the value of an implicit association element for that port. Instead, the 
value of the expression is used to determine the effective value of that port 
during simulation if the port is left unconnected (see <A 
href="1076_12.html#12.6.2">12.6.2 
</A>). </P>
<P>3--Named association may not be used when invoking implicitly defined 
operations, since the formal parameters of these operators are not named (see <A 
href="1076_7.html#7.2">7.2 
</A>). </P>
<P>4--Since information flows only from the actual to the formal when the mode 
of the formal is <B>in</B>, and since a function call is itself an expression, 
the actual associated with a formal of object class <B>constant</B> is never 
interpreted as a conversion function or a type conversion converting an actual 
designator that is an expression. Thus, the following association element is 
legal: </P><PRE>     Param =&gt; F (<B>open</B>)

<P>under the conditions that Param is a constant formal and F is a function 
returning the same base type as that of Param and having one or more parameters,

  <LI>A signature may not appear in a declaration of an object alias. 
  <LI>The name must be a static name (see <A 
  href="1076_6.html#6.1">6.1 
  </A>) that denotes an object. The base type of the name specified in an alias 
  declaration must be the same as the base type of the type mark in the subtype 
  indication (if the subtype indication is present); this type must not be a 
  multi-dimensional array type. When the object denoted by the name is 
  referenced via the alias defined by the alias declaration, the following rules 
  apply: </LI></OL>
<P>-- If the subtype indication is absent or if it is present and denotes an 
unconstrained array type: </P>
<P>-- If the alias designator denotes a slice of an object, then the subtype of 
the object is viewed as if it were of the subtype specified by the slice </P>
<P>-- Otherwise, the object is viewed as if it were of the subtype specified in 
the declaration of the object denoted by the name </P>
<P>-- If the subtype indication is present and denotes a constrained array 
subtype, then the object is viewed as if it were of the subtype specified by the 
subtype indication; moreover, the subtype denoted by the subtype indication must 
include a matching element (see <A 
href="1076_7.html#7.2.2">7.2.2 
</A>) for each element of the object denoted by the name; </P>
<P>-- If the subtype indication denotes a scalar subtype, then the object is 
viewed as if it were of the subtype specified by the subtype 
indication;moreover, it is an error if this subtype does not have the same 
bounds and direction as the subtype denoted by the object name. </P>
<OL type=a>
  <LI>The same applies to attribute references where the prefix of the attribute 
  name denotes the alias. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>A reference to an element of an object alias is implicitly a reference to 
  the matching element of the object denoted by the alias. A reference to a 
  slice of an object alias consisting of the elements e<SUB>1</SUB>, 
  e<SUB>2</SUB>, ..., e<SUB>n</SUB> is implicitly a reference to a slice of the

<P>The following rules apply to nonobject aliases: </P>
<OL type=a>
  <LI>A subtype indication may not appear in a nonobject alias. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>A signature is required if the name denotes a subprogram (including an 
  operator) or enumeration literal. In this case, the signature is required to 
  match (see <A 
  href="1076_2.html#2.3">2.3 
  </A>) the parameter and result type profile of exactly one of the subprograms 
  or enumeration literals denoted by the name. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>If the name denotes an enumeration type, then one implicit alias 
  declaration for each of the literals of the type immediately follows the alias 
  declaration for the enumeration type; each such implicit declaration has, as 
  its alias designator, the simple name or character literal of the literal and 
  has, as its name, a name constructed by taking the name of the alias for thee 
  numeration type and substituting the simple name or character literal being 
  aliased for the simple name of the type. Each implicit alias has a signature 
  that matches the parameter and result type profile of the literal being 
  aliased. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Alternatively, if the name denotes a physical type, then one implicitali 
  as declaration for each of the units of the type immediately follows the alias 
  declaration for the physical type; each such implicit declaration has, as its 
  name, a name constructed by taking the name of the alias for the physical type 
  and substituting the simple name of the unit being aliased for the simple name 
  of the type. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Finally, if the name denotes a type, then implicit alias declarations for 
  each predefined operator for the type immediately follow the explicit alias 
  declaration for the type and, if present, any implicit alias declarations for 
  literals or units of the type. Each implicit alias has a signature that 
  matches the parameter and result type profile of the implicit operator being 
  aliased. </LI></OL>

</A>Attribute declarations</H2>
<P>An attribute is a value, function, type, range, signal, or constant that may 
be associated with one or more named entities in a description. There are two 
categories of attributes: predefined attributes and user-defined attributes. 
Predefined attributes provide information about named entities in a description. 
Section 14 contains the definition of all predefined attributes. Predefined 
attributes that are signals may not be updated. </P>
<P>User-defined attributes are constants of arbitrary type. Such attributes are 
defined by an attribute declaration. </P><PRE>     attribute_declaration ::=

          <B>attribute</B> identifier: type_mark ;

</PRE>
<P>The identifier is said to be the <I>designator</I> of the attribute. An 
attribute may be associated with an entity declaration, an architecture, a 
configuration,a procedure, a function, a package, a type, a subtype, a constant, 
a signal, a variable, a component, a label, a literal, a unit, a group, or a 
file. </P>
<P>The type mark must denote a subtype that is neither an access type nor a file 
type. The subtype need not be constrained. </P>
<P><I>Examples:</I> </P><PRE>     <B>type</B> COORDINATE <B>is</B> <B>record</B> X,Y: INTEGER; <B>end</B> <B>record</B>;

     <B>attribute</B> LOCATION: COORDINATE;

     <B>attribute</B> PIN_NO: POSITIVE;



</PRE>
<H4>NOTES</H4>
<P>1--A given named entity E will be decorated with the user-defined attribute A 
if and only if an attribute specification for the value of attribute A exists in 
the same declarative part as the declaration of E. In the absence of such a 
specification, an attribute name of the form E'A is illegal. </P>
<P>2--A user-defined attribute is associated with the named entity denoted by 
the name specified in a declaration, not with the name itself. Hence, an 
attribute of an object can be referenced by using an alias for that object 
rather than the declared name of the object as the prefix of the attribute name, 
and the attribute referenced in such a way is the same attribute (and therefore 
has the same value) as the attribute referenced by using the declared name of 
the object as the prefix. </P>
<P>3--A user-defined attribute of a port, signal, variable, or constant of some 
composite type is an attribute of the entire port, signal, variable, or 
constant, not of its elements. If it is necessary to associate an attribute with 
each element of some composite object, then the attribute itself can be declared 
to be of a composite type such that for each element of the object,there is a 
corresponding element of the attribute. </P>

</PRE>
<P>It is an error if the class of any group constituent in the group constituent 
list is not the same as the class specified by the corresponding entity class

<P>A name that is a group constituent may not be an attribute name (see <A

</A>), nor, if it contains a prefix, may that prefix be a function call. </P>
<P>If a group declaration appears within a package body, and a group constituent 
within that group declaration is the same as the simple name of the package 
body, then the group constituent denotes the package declaration and not the 
package body. The same rule holds for group declarations appearing within 
subprogram bodies containing group constituents with the same designator as that 
of the enclosing subprogram body. </P>
<P>If a group declaration contains a group constituent that denotes a variable
