<H1>Names</H1>
<P></P>
<P>The rules applicable to the various forms of name are described in this 
section. </P>

</A>Names</H2>
<P>Names can denote declared entities, whether declared explicitly or 
implicitly. Names can also denote </P>
<P>-- Objects denoted by access values, </P>
<P>-- Subelements of composite objects, </P>
<P>-- Subelements of composite values, </P>
<P>-- Slices of composite objects, </P>
<P>-- Slices of composite values, and </P>
<P>-- Attributes of any named entity. </P><PRE>     name ::=

           simple_name

        | operator_symbol

        | selected_name

        | indexed_name

        | slice_name

        | attribute_name



     prefix ::=

           name

        | function_call

</PRE>
<P>Certain forms of name (indexed and selected names, slices, and attribute 
names) include a <I>prefix</I> that is a name or a function call. If the prefix 
of a name is a function call, then the name denotes an element, a slice, or an 
attribute, either of the result of the function call, or (if the result is an 
access value) of the object designated by the result. Function calls are defined 
in <A 
href="1076_7.html#7.3.3">7.3.3 
</A>. </P>
<P>If the type of a prefix is an access type, then the prefix must not be a name 
that denotes a formal parameter of mode <B>out</B> or a subelement thereof. </P>
<P>A prefix is said to be <I>appropriate</I> for a type in either of the 
following cases: </P>
<P>-- The type of the prefix is the type considered. </P>
<P>-- The type of the prefix is an access type whose designated type is the type 
considered. </P>
<P>The evaluation of a name determines the named entity denoted by the name. The 
evaluation of a name that has a prefix includes the evaluation of the 
prefix,that is, of the corresponding name or function call. If the type of the 
prefix is an access type, the evaluation of the prefix includes the 
determination of the object designated by the corresponding access value. In 
such a case, it is an error if the value of the prefix is a null access value. 
It is an error if,after all type analysis (including overload resolution) the 
name is ambiguous. </P>
<P>A name is said to be a <I>static</I> <I>name</I> if and only if one of the 
following conditions holds: </P>
<P>-- The name is a simple name or selected name (including those that are 
expanded names) that does not denote a function call or an object or value of an 
access type and (in the case of a selected name) whose prefix is a static name. 
</P>
<P>-- The name is an indexed name whose prefix is a static name, and every 
expression that appears as part of the name is a static expression. </P>
<P>-- The name is a slice name whose prefix is a static name and whose discrete 
range is a static discrete range. </P>
<P>Furthermore, a name is said to be a <I>locally static name</I> if and only if 
one of the following conditions hold: </P>
<P>-- The name is a simple name or selected name (including those that are 
expanded names) that is not an alias and that does not denote a function call or 
an object or a value of an access type and (in the case of a selected name) 
whose prefix is a locally static name. </P>
<P>-- The name is a simple name or selected name (including those that are 
expanded names) that is an alias, and that the aliased name given in the 
corresponding alias declaration (see <A 
href="1076_4.html#4.3.3">4.3.3 
</A>) is a locally static name, and (in the case of a selected name) whose 
prefix is a locally static name. </P>
<P>-- The name is an indexed name whose prefix is a locally static name, and 
every expression that appears as part of the name is a locally static 
expression. </P>
<P>-- The name is a slice name whose prefix is a locally static name and whose 
discrete range is a locally static discrete range. </P>
<P>A <I>static signal name</I> is a static name that denotes a signal. The 
<I>longest static prefix</I> of a signal name is the name itself, if the name is 
a static signal name; otherwise, it is the longest prefix of the name that is a 
static signal name. Similarly, a <I>static variable name</I> is a static name 
that denotes a variable, and the longest static prefix of a variable name is the 
name itself, if the name is a static variable name; otherwise, it is the longest 
prefix of the name that is a static variable name. </P>
<P><I>Examples:</I> </P><PRE>     S(C,2)            --  A static name: C is a static constant.

     R(J <B>to</B> 16)        --  A nonstatic name: J is a signal.

                       --  R is the longest static prefix of R(J <B>to</B> 16).



     T(n)              --  A static name; n is a generic constant.

     T(2)              --  A locally static name.

<H2><A name=6.2></A><A 
href="1076_6.html#6.2">6.2 
</A>Simple names</H2>
<P>A simple name for a named entity is either the identifier associated with the 
entity by its declaration, or another identifier associated with the entity by 
an alias declaration. In particular, the simple name for an entity interface, a 
configuration, a package, a procedure, or a function is the identifier that 
appears in the corresponding entity declaration, configuration declaration, 
package declaration, procedure declaration, or function declaration, 
respectively. The simple name of an architecture is that defined by the 
identifier of the architecture body. </P><PRE>     simple_name ::=  identifier

</PRE>
<P>The evaluation of a simple name has no other effect than to determine the 
named entity denoted by the name. </P>
<H2><A name=6.3></A><A 
href="1076_6.html#6.3">6.3 
</A>Selected names</H2>
<P>A selected name is used to denote a named entity whose declaration appears 
either within the declaration of another named entity or within a design 
library. </P><PRE>     selected_name ::=  prefix . suffix



     suffix ::=

            simple_name

          | character_literal

          | operator_symbol

          | <B>all</B>

</PRE>
<P>A selected name may be used to denote an element of a record, an object 
designated by an access value, or a named entity whose declaration is contained 
within another named entity, particularly within a library or a package. 
Furthermore, a selected name may be used to denote all named entities whose 
declarations are contained within a library or a package. </P>
<P>For a selected name that is used to denote a record element, the suffix must 
be a simple name denoting an element of a record object or value. The prefix 
must be appropriate for the type of this object or value. </P>
<P>For a selected name that is used to denote the object designated by an access 
value, the suffix must be the reserved word <B>all</B>. The prefix must belong 
to an access type. </P>
<P>The remaining forms of selected names are called <I>expanded names</I>. The 
prefix of an expanded name may not be a function call. </P>
<P>An expanded name denotes a primary unit contained in a design library if the 
prefix denotes the library and the suffix is the simple name of a primary unit 
whose declaration is contained in that library. An expanded name denotes all 
primary units contained in a library if the prefix denotes the library and the 
suffix is the reserved word <B>all</B>. An expanded name is not allowed for a 
secondary unit, particularly for an architecture body. </P>
<P>An expanded name denotes a named entity declared in a package if the prefix 
denotes the package and the suffix is the simple name, character literal, or 
operator symbol of a named entity whose declaration occurs immediately within 
that package. An expanded name denotes all named entities declared in a package 
if the prefix denotes the package and the suffix is the reserved word 
<B>all</B>. </P>
<P>An expanded name denotes a named entity declared immediately within a named 
construct if the prefix denotes a construct that is an entity interface, an 
architecture, a subprogram, a block statement, a process statement, a generate 
statement, or a loop statement, and the suffix is the simple name, character 
literal, or operator symbol of a named entity whose declaration occurs 
immediately within that construct. This form of expanded name is only allowed 
within the construct itself. </P>
<P>If, according to the visibility rules, there is at least one possible 
interpretation of the prefix of a selected name as the name of an enclosing 
entity interface, architecture, subprogram, block statement, process statement, 
generate statement, or loop statement, then the only interpretations considered 
are those of the immediately preceding paragraph. In this case, the selected 
name is always interpreted as an expanded name. In particular, no 
interpretations of the prefix as a function call are considered. </P>
<P><I>Examples:</I> </P><PRE>     --  Given the following declarations:



     <B>type</B> INSTR_TYPE <B>is</B>

        <B>record</B>

            OPCODE:    OPCODE_TYPE;

        <B>end</B> <B>record</B>;

     <B>signal</B> INSTRUCTION: INSTR_TYPE;



     --  The name "INSTRUCTION.OPCODE" is the name of a record element.



     --  Given the following declarations:





     <B>type</B> INSTR_PTR <B>is</B> <B>access</B> INSTR_TYPE;

     <B>variable</B> PTR: INSTR_PTR;



     --  The name "PTR.<B>all</B>" is the name of the object designated by PTR.



     --  Given the following library clause:



     <B>library</B> TTL, CMOS;



     --  The name "TTL.SN74LS221" is the name of a design unit contained in a library

     --  and the name "CMOS.<B>all</B>" denotes all design units contained in a library.



     --  Given the following declaration and use clause:



     <B>library</B> MKS;

     <B>use</B> MKS.MEASUREMENTS, STD.STANDARD;



     --  The name "MEASUREMENTS.VOLTAGE" denotes a named entity declared in a

     --  package and the name "STANDARD.<B>all</B>" denotes all named entities declared in a

     --  package.



     --  Given the following process label and declarative part:





     P: <B>process</B>

         <B>variable</B> DATA: INTEGER;

     <B>begin</B>



     --  Within process P, the name "P.DATA" denotes a named entity declared in process P.



     <B>end</B> <B>process</B>;

</PRE>
<P></P>
<H4>NOTES</H4>
<P>1--The object denoted by an access value is accessed differently depending on 
whether the entire object or a subelement of the object is desired. If the 
entire object is desired, a selected name whose prefix denotes the access value 
and whose suffix is the reserved word <B>all</B> is used. In this case, the 
access value is not automatically dereferenced, since it is necessary to 
distinguish an access value from the object denoted by an access value. </P>
<P>If a subelement of the object is desired, a selected name whose prefix 
denotes the access value is again used; however, the suffix in this case denotes 
the subelement. In this case, the access value is automatically dereferenced. 
</P>
<P>These two cases are shown in the following example: </P><PRE>     <B>type</B> rec;



     <B>type</B> recptr <B>is</B> <B>access</B> rec;



     <B>type</B> rec <B>is</B>

          <B>record</B>

                value        : INTEGER;

                \next\       : recptr;

          <B>end</B> <B>record</B>;



     <B>variable</B> list1, list2: recptr;

     <B>variable</B> recobj: rec;



     list2 := list1;          --  Access values are copied;

                                        --  list1 and list2 now denote the same object.

     list2 := list1.\next\;   --  list2 denotes the same object as list1.\next\.

                                        --  list1.\next\ is the same as list1.all.\next\.

                                        --  An implicit dereference of the access value occurs before the

                                        --  "\next\" field is selected.

     recobj := list2.all      --  An explicit dereference is needed here.

</PRE>
<P>2--Overload resolution may be used to disambiguate selected names. See rules 
1 and 3 of <A 
href="1076_10.html#10.5">10.5 
</A>. </P>
<P>3--If, according to the rules of this clause and of <A 
href="1076_10.html#10.5">10.5 
</A>, there is not exactly one interpretation of a selected name that satisfies 
these rules, then the selected name is ambiguous. </P>
<H2><A name=6.4></A><A 
href="1076_6.html#6.4">6.4 
</A>Indexed names</H2>
<P>An indexed name denotes an element of an array. </P><PRE>     indexed_name ::=  prefix ( expression { , expression } )

</PRE>
<P>The prefix of an indexed name must be appropriate for an array type. The 
expressions specify the index values for the element; there must be one such 
expression for each index position of the array, and each expression must be of 
the type of the corresponding index. For the evaluation of an indexed name,the 
prefix and the expressions are evaluated. It is an error if an index value does 
not belong to the range of the corresponding index range of the array. </P>
<P><I>Examples:</I> </P><PRE>     REGISTER_ARRAY(5)          --  An element of a one-dimensional array.

     MEMORY_CELL(1024,7)        --  An element of a two-dimensional array.

</PRE>
<P>NOTE--If a name (including one used as a prefix) has an interpretation both 
as an indexed name and as a function call, then the innermost complete context 
is used to disambiguate the name. If, after applying this rule, there is not 
exactly one interpretation of the name, then the name is ambiguous. See <A 
href="1076_10.html#10.5">10.5 
</A>. </P>
<H2><A name=6.5></A><A 
href="1076_6.html#6.5">6.5 
</A>Slice names</H2>
<P>A slice name denotes a one-dimensional array composed of a sequence of 
consecutive elements of another one-dimensional array. A slice of a signal is a 
signal; a slice of a variable is a variable; a slice of a constant is a 
constant; a slice of a value is a value. </P><PRE>     slice_name ::=  prefix ( discrete_range )

</PRE>
<P>The prefix of a slice must be appropriate for a one-dimensional array object. 
The base type of this array type is the type of the slice. </P>
<P>The bounds of the discrete range define those of the slice and must be of the 
type of the index of the array. The slice is a <I>null slice</I> if the discrete 
range is a null range. It is an error if the direction of the discrete range is 
not the same as that of the index range of the array denoted by the prefix of 
the slice name. </P>
<P>For the evaluation of a name that is a slice, the prefix and the discrete 
range are evaluated. It is an error if either of the bounds of the discrete 
range does not belong to the index range of the prefixing array, unless the 
slice is a null slice. (The bounds of a null slice need not belong to the 
subtype of the index.) </P>
<P><I>Examples:</I> </P><PRE>     <B>signal</B>   R15:  BIT_VECTOR (0 <B>to</B> 31) ;

     <B>constant</B>     DATA:       BIT_VECTOR (31 <B>downto</B> 0) ;



     R15(0 <B>to</B> 7)                 --  A slice with an ascending range.

     DATA(24 <B>downto</B> 1)           --  A slice with a descending range.

     DATA(1 <B>downto</B> 24)           --  A null slice.

     DATA(24 <B>to</B> 25)              --  An error.

</PRE>
<P>NOTE--If A is a one-dimensional array of objects, the name A(N <B>to</B> N) 
or A(N <B>downto</B> N) is a slice that contains one element; its type is the 
base type of A. On the other hand, A(N) is an element of the array A and has the 
corresponding element type. </P>
<H2><A name=6.6></A><A 
href="1076_6.html#6.6">6.6 
</A>Attribute names</H2>
<P>An attribute name denotes a value, function, type, range, signal, or constant 
associated with a named entity. </P><PRE>     attribute_name ::=

          prefix [ signature ] ' attribute_designator [ ( expression ) ]



     attribute_designator ::=  <I>attribute</I>_simple_name

</PRE>
<P>The applicable attribute designators depend on the prefix plus the signature, 
if any. The meaning of the prefix of an attribute must be determinable 
independently of the attribute designator and independently of the fact that it 
is the prefix of an attribute. </P>
<P>A signature may follow the prefix if and only if the prefix denotes a 
subprogram or enumeration literal, or an alias thereof. In this case, the 
signature is required to match (see <A 
href="1076_2.html#2.3.2">2.3.2 
</A>) the parameter and result type profile of exactly one visible subprogram or 
enumeration literal, as is appropriate to the prefix. </P>
<P>If the attribute designator denotes a predefined attribute, the expression 
either must or may appear, depending upon the definition of that attribute (see 
Section 14); otherwise, it must not be present. </P>
<P>If the prefix of an attribute name denotes an alias, then the attribute name 
denotes an attribute of the aliased name and not the alias itself, except when 
the attribute designator denotes any of the predefined attributes 'SIMPLE_NAME, 
'PATH_NAME, or 'INSTANCE_NAME. If the prefix of an attribute name denotes an 
alias and the attribute designator denotes any of the predefined attributes 
SIMPLE_NAME, 'PATH_NAME, or 'INSTANCE_NAME, then the attribute name denotes the 
attribute of the alias and not of the aliased name. </P>
<P>If the attribute designator denotes a user-defined attribute, the prefix 
cannot denote a subelement or a slice of an object. </P>
<P><I>Examples:</I> </P><PRE>     REG'LEFT(1)              --  The leftmost index bound of array REG.



     INPUT_PIN'PATH_NAME      --  The hierarchical path name of the port INPUT_PIN.



     CLK'DELAYED(5 ns)        --  The signal CLK delayed by 5 ns.
